			<h2>Société Générale - PARIS, FRANCE💳</h2>
			<p>
		Since January 2021, I'm doing an internship as Community Manager at Société Générale, one of the main French banking groups. This experience is extremely instructive, and I really appreciate discovering what working for a CAC40 group actually is.

			<h2>Le Week-End - PARIS, FRANCE☕️</h2>
			<p>
		For my very first professional experience in my life, I chose to do a 2-month long job as a waiter in the Parisian café "Le Week-End", in 2018 (working there during the 2018 World Cup was extremely wonderful!)
